# BRUTA TYPE

**Monospaced. Geometric. Unapologetic.**

Bruta is a bold and expressive typeface with a rigid skeleton and zero tolerance for ornament.  
It’s built for order, but comfortable with dissent.

With squared shapes, heavy structure and sharp cuts, Bruta speaks in a tone somewhere between brutalist signage and bureaucratic sarcasm.  
Ideal for manifestos, angry labels, absurd forms, institutional posters, and typographic deadpan.

Available for free under the SIL Open Font License.  
No italics. No apologies.
